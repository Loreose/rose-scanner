# 🌹 Rose Scanner

Rose Scanner is basically very similar to the black market script, only it was rethought and translated into a different format, the logic remains the same.

Enjoy!

## ⚙️ How To Use

This FiveM script uses GetGamePool native, which is a FiveM Native, this native handles objects such as objects, peds, vehicles rendered on the map, I am using this native in this script, so please navigate the map after using the /scan command.

- Use the /scan command.
- Navigate the GTA5 map.
- Get your coordinates from the found_coords.txt file.
- Use them however you like.
